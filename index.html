                 Italian, French, German, and Spanish styles. It might be the most complete western architecture complex nationwide. If interested, you could ride the horse cart to go through the avenues, which make you feel like travelling to the past.

            <li class="places-title"> Tianjin Eye</li>
            <p class="places-des">Tianjin Eye is a giant ferris wheel constructed on a bridge over Haihe River. Sitting in the carriage of Tianjin Eye, you would overlook the cars driving past the bridge and the magnificent cityscapes along Haihe River as the carriage reaches
                 its highest point of 120 meters (394 feet). Especially, the brilliant night cityscapes are more charming. So Tianjin Eye is listed to be one of Tianjin places of interest. The carriages move slowly, and you can enjoy a ride as long as half an hour.</p>
