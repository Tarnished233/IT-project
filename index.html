            <p>Located near Beijing, Tianjin's weather is similarly characterized by four distinct seasons – dry and windy springs, hot and rainy summers, cool and pleasant autumns, dry and cold winters. Like most cities in northern China, July tends to be the  hottest
                 month, during which the average temperature can reach 26 C (79 F) or even higher, while January is the coldest with an average temperature of -4 C (25 F).

            <li class="seasons">Spring</li>
            <p class="weather-des">The weather in spring from late March to early May is pleasant and suitable for traveling. You can go outing to climb Mt. Panshan and pay a visit to the Dule Temple at the foot of the mountain on your way back as well. However,
                 there will be windy weather and sandstorms occasionally. In early spring, you may have to wear a wool sweater plus a thick jacket (or a wind coat), but a long-sleeved T-shirt may be enough for late spring.</p>
            <li class="seasons">Summer</li>
            <p class="weather-des">Summer in the area is usually from middle May to the end of August when the climate is also very sultry. The rainy season of June to August generates 75% of the whole year's rainfall, so rainwear is a requisite. The temperature
                 difference between day and night can be big, so it is best to wear a light overcoat at night so as not to get a cold. The annual Tianjin Beer Festival is held in July.</p>
            <li class="seasons">Fall</li>
            <p class="weather-des">Autumn weather is cool with a mild and pleasant temperature, but only lasting 50-56 days from September to late October. At this time, you may just bring long-sleeved T-shirts plus one or two light overcoats. The autumn Iis a good
                 time to enjoy the red, yellow and green leaves on Huangyaguan Great Wall.</p>
            <li class="seasons">Winter</li>
            <p class="weather-des">Winter there is both cold and long, starting from November and ending in February. The temperature can drop to -15 C (5 F), accompanied by a piercing wind. Thus, you have to wear wool sweaters, down coats, woolen scarfs and gloves.
                 It has become a fashion to have a hot spring spa at Dijing Hot Spring City or Donglihu Hot Spring Holiday Resort.</p>

            <p>As one of the most beloved and sought-after street snacks in the vibrant city of Tianjin, jianbing has firmly established itself as a dominant force in the breakfast industry, captivating the palates of locals and tourists alike. This traditional pancake,
                 known for its distinctive preparation, begins with a thin batter spread evenly to form a delicate pancake base. Mung bean noodles are meticulously layered onto this base, adding both texture and nutritional value. Next, eggs are cracked and spread over
                  the surface, followed by a generous sprinkling of fresh coriander and finely chopped scallion, which infuse the dish with a burst of aromatic flavors. A unique, savory sauce is then brushed over the entire surface, enhancing the overall taste profile.
                   The final touch involves adding a crispy, crunchy element, such as a fried dough stick or a crispy cracker, which provides a delightful contrast to the softness of the pancake.</p>
