            <h1 id="places-title">5 places to go</h1>
            <li class="places-title">Five Great Avenues</li>
            <p class="places-des, long">Five Great Avenues is a must Tianjin place to visit. Originally, it was the foreign concession, so you can see more than 2,000 old buildings in western styles in the block, including over 300 well preserved ones in British,
                 Italian, French, German, and Spanish styles. It might be the most complete western architecture complex nationwide. If interested, you could ride the horse cart to go through the avenues, which make you feel like travelling to the past.
                  Other interesting ways to visit those exotic houses are taking a rickshaw or riding a bicycle.</p>
            <li class="places-title"> Tianjin Eye</li>
            <p class="places-des">Tianjin Eye is a giant ferris wheel constructed on a bridge over Haihe River. Sitting in the carriage of Tianjin Eye, you would overlook the cars driving past the bridge and the magnificent cityscapes along Haihe River as the carriage reaches
                 its highest point of 120 meters (394 feet). Especially, the brilliant night cityscapes are more charming. So Tianjin Eye is listed to be one of Tianjin places of interest. The carriages move slowly, and you can enjoy a ride as long as half an hour.</p>
            <li class="places-title">Ancient Cultural Street</li>
            <p class="places-des">Among all places to visit in Tianjin China, Ancient Cultural Street is the best for culture lovers. Centered on the Temple of the Queen of Heaven, it preserves many time-honored shops selling featured handicrafts and local food. You could admire
                 the traditional porcelains, lacquerwares, embroideries, colored clay sculptures, wood-block paintings, etc. and taste mouth-watering Goubuli Steamed Buns, Pancake Rolled with Crisp Fritter, and more local snacks. Around Chinese New Year and the 23rd day of the
                  third lunar month, there are grand temple fairs, making the ancient street the most bustling place in the whole city.</p>
            <li class="places-title">Jinwan Square</li>
            <p class="places-des">Jinwan Square, in the city center by Haihe River, is the busiest area and the best site to capture the cityscapes in Tianjin. Standing there, you could see the former French concession with various western buildings and hundred-year-old
                 Jiefang<br> Bridge. Behind, the landmark Century Clock and Tianjin Railway Station show you modern cityscape of Tianjin. Thus Jinwan Square becomes one of top places to go in Tianjin, to see both the old and new look of the city. The night views are even more beautiful
                  with the help of colorful lights. </p>
            <li class="places-title">Yangliuqing Ancient Town</li>
            <p class="places-des">In the northwestern suburb of Tianjin, Yangliuqing Ancient Town, one of the historical Tianjin points of interest, is especially famous for its folk arts. The Yangliuqing wood-block painting was created there, which is the most famous art
                 form there. If interested, you may learn to make a wood-block painting in person. In addition to the wood-block paintings, the kite making, paper cuttings, and more folk arts can be seen there. Coming here, you are also advised to take a walk along the old
